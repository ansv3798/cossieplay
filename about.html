      <h3>WHAT IS COSPLAY?</h3>
      <p> Cosplay is the combination of the words “costume” and “role-play”. It is used to describe dressing up as a character from games, movies, anime, comics and more. Cosplay is a pastime enjoyed by young and old and Oz Comic-Con celebrates this community with showcases, competitions and more! Coming in cosplay to Oz Comic-Con? Be sure to read our Cosplay Props policy!
