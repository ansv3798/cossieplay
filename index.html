      <h3>Cosplay – Hulkstown 2017</h3>
      <p>
      Are you a step above the parade but not quite ready for the championship? Do you have a skit to perform or want to tell the audience about your costume? Then this is the competition for you!
      
      This event requires you to sign up online – no on-the-day sign-ups or additions will be taken. This event will take place on the Saturday of Oz Comic-Con.
      The Supanova Cosplay Competition presented by Madman Entertainment is always the highlight of a Supanova weekend for so many people.
      
      It’s time to finish off your amazing costume, put together your best performance and make that stage your own as you compete for amazing prizes. Our cosplay judges will be looking for the best from all our entrants and rewarding those who stand above the rest.
      
      In 2017 we welcome our new category sponsor Ironlak, who will be supporting our ‘Saturday Best in Show’ through the year with an amazing $1,000 voucher on their range of incredible paints and other art supplies.
